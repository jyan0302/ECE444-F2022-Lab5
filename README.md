## Pros and Cons of TDD
### Pros
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. TDD helps developers find bugs early in the development cycle, and reduces the time spent debugging. TDD is a design technique that encourages simple designs and inspires confidence. Lastly, TDD helps developers verify that their code meets the requirements of the application.

### Cons
TDD is a time consuming process. It requires developers to write tests before writing code. It also requires developers to write tests for every feature. Another downfall is the related to the McNamara fallacy, where there is a overreliance on code coverage. Code coverage is the percentage of code that is covered by tests. The McNamara fallacy is when developers write tests for the sake of writing tests. This can lead to tests that are not useful. Lastly, TDD can be difficult to implement in legacy code. Legacy code is code that is not well designed and is difficult to change.
